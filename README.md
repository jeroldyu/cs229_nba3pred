As NBA teams have begun to embrace data analytics, more emphasis has been placed on shooting and spacing the floor. The three-point shot, in particular, is becoming increasingly prevalent in the NBA. Players and teams have been taking more threes than ever, and recruiters are increasingly looking to recruit members who will be proficient three-point shooters in the NBA. The goal of this project is to project the best three-point shooters among top NCAA prospects.

Using a player's statistics from the NCAA and the NBA as inputs, along with team statistics on both leagues, our model outputted a three-point shooting percentage for that player.
